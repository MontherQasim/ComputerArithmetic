# ComputerArithmetic
A computer arithmetic repository is a collection of resources, algorithms, and code related to the implementation of arithmetic operations in digital systems. It includes a range of techniques and methods used to perform arithmetic operations on digital data, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Requirements ##

To use this code, you'll need to download and install Logisim Evolution software, which you can find at https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution/releases.
Logisim is a free, open-source digital logic simulator that allows you to create and test digital circuits. It's a powerful tool that's used by students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.
Once you've installed Logisim Evolution, you can open the .circ files in this repository and start exploring!

## Contents ##

This repository contains:
1- Koggeâ€“Stone 32-bit
Kogge-Stone is a parallel algorithm for performing addition and subtraction operations on binary numbers.The algorithm works by breaking down the addition or subtraction operation into smaller sub-problems that can be solved in parallel. The algorithm uses a tree-like structure to perform the operations, with each level of the tree representing a different bit position in the binary numbers being added or subtracted. At each level of the tree, the algorithm performs a carry-lookahead operation to determine the carry-in and carry-out values for that level. This allows the algorithm to quickly propagate carry values through the tree and perform the addition or subtraction in parallel.
